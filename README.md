In this study, our objective is to first present a critical examination of the history of the initial conceptualization of statistical dependence developed by Bayes, Galton, Pearson, and subsequently by other scientists. We discuss the various challenges that scientists faced and overcame while developing the procedures for measuring dependence that are now widely used. Then, We clarify the hidden assumptions and limits of various types of correlation measurements, as well as provide practitioners with improved model-free and model-based alternatives from the existing literature. We also analyze the interpretation of the correlation measurements and several instances in which the application of the correlation approach may be improper. The concepts discussed in this study are supported by examples from literature in the field of economics and finance. The ultimate goal of this study is to highlight that statistical measures and methods can mislead us if we blindly generate them without checking the assumptions and limitations of the methods and without considering the nature of the data in our hands. Comparing the benefits and drawbacks of various measures of dependence will allow us to create a road map for practitioners and researchers on which measures of dependence to use in which circumstances. We aim to continue this research in high dimensional space which will provide a crucial contribution to it's regular use by many practitioners in big data and machine learning.
